A1 is an assignment to use apriori algorithm to find association rule of given itemsets. This program implements the FP-Growth (Frequent Pattern Growth) algorithm to mine frequent itemsets from a CSV file and generate association rules based on confidence and lift.
Functionality
1、Read transaction data from a CSV file
2、Construct an FP-Tree (Frequent Pattern Tree)
3、Mine frequent itemsets from the FP-Tree
4、Generate association rules based on confidence and lift
5、Output rules that meet the specified thresholds
